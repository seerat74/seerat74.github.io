        "Things can often get dark in your scene, Scorpio. Your intensity and passion sometimes makes for a seriously moody experience.

As long as you're seeing this world and experiencing everything it has to offer, you'll be happy. Out of all the signs, you're one of the most idealistic and approach adventure with such a positive attitude — and we know traveling can be a little tricky at times.",
